## Preview 01/22/2020
In this preview you will be able to hear my current progress with outsourced assets. My goal for this preview was to create
the ambiance of an old western bar, and I did that by looping background chatter, a classical piano piece, desert wind, and pool players.
I had to get the volume for each effect just right so that one sound didn't overtake any others.
